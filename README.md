# Plot

You come from a species that 500 years ago was not too dissimilar to present-day humans, primitive and barbaric, violent, barely under control, and ready to kill each other at a moments notice.  All that changed when you decided to dispose of your flesh and blood bodies in exchange for the perfection of technology.  Your new robotic bodies give you a new perspective on life, and your neural connections to your fellow citizens give you a sense of community.  Your people now travel the galaxy looking for other civilizations worthy enough for first contact and to receive your technological marvels.
	You have been chosen to travel to Earth for it’s second inspection, the first having ended in disaster over 90 years ago.  You choose to visit New Orleans in Louisiana known for its extremely high crime and suicide rates, to see the worst these humans have to offer.  While your holographic camouflage should easily disguise you to look human, your prime directive is to remain undetected.  You must not directly interfere, but only observe what you see.  After gathering your data you will have to decide what your recommendation to the committee will be regarding the humans.
	But just when you think you know what’s going on…you don’t.  Your troubles begin almost as soon as you land on the hellhole known as Earth.  The poisons in the atmosphere interfere with your visual sub-processor and your short-term memory banks are malfunctioning, you don’t even remember landing.  Under pressure to continue the mission, you find yourself surrounded by the “citizens” of New Orleans, even needing their help on rare occasions.  Your superiors back home, while clear and distinct in your memory, seem to be hiding something.  Their orders concerning the humans and the first inspector seem to be logical, but you defiantly don’t trust them.
	You meet a crazy lady that claims to be your wife; how insane these humans are!  You remember your wife back home very clearly, yet this woman insists on being your spouse living in a house a few blocks down.  You leave, finding her strangely familiar, only to have glimpses of your real memories rush to your head, overshadowing the ones implanted in you if only for just a second.
	You must find out who that woman was, and if she was telling the truth.  You again enlist the help of a storeowner, a rare human among his kind, only to find out the horrific and undeniable truth…that you yourself are human!  All that your memories and senses tell you are false.  The aliens, the real aliens, contact you knowing of your discovery.  They offer a deal: your life back in exchange for the data you’ve collected of the humans and from the first inspector.  You meet them at the ship, which then flies off into the night sky, leaving your recent memories wiped.  You look at your wife and fellow humans, pick up some weapons, and head off to the nearest bank.
