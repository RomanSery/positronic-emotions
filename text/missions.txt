ROBOT: This is central command, do you read me. Have you successfully touched down?%YOU: Roger, there's something wrong with my visual subprocessor, its malfunctiong.  My short-term memory banks are damaged, I can't remember landing.%ROBOT: It must be the poisons in the atmosphere, you'll need to repair it somehow.  There's no reason for your memory loss, but you'll have to make do, we can't just abort the mission.%YOU: Yes sir, you can count on me. What do I do about my vision?%ROBOT: Find some kind of hardware store, it should be near by. You can use what you acquire with the equipment on your ship.
YOU: Good day, fine citizen of New Orleans. I require your assistance.%CLERK: You're not from around here, are you?  Well that's okay, welcome to Joe's hardware store. What can I get you?%YOU: I need a phase coil modulator.%JOE: Okay...coming right up, should be around here somewhere.  Here we go, that'll be $129.99.%YOU: I'm sorry, I don't have any New Orleanian currency.%JOE: You mean you don't have the money; sorry I cant give it to you then.%YOU: Please, I really need it. I'm...sick, my eyes hurt.%JOE: Well...okay, okay. I'll give it you, I doubt anyone else would've bought it. Don't know how it'll help your eyes though.%YOU: Thank you citizen of New Orleans, Joe.
CLERK: Don't know how that phase modulator is going to help your eyes, but I hope it does.% YOU: Thanks
ROBOT: Good, you should be able to use that phase modulator. Get back to your ship, but make sure no one follows you.%YOU: Sir, I can't remember where I landed.%ROBOT: Short-term memory still damaged?  Well at least you know what it looks like, right?  Just look in places out of sight, it should be nearby.
YOU: Central Command, do you copy?  Visual sub-proccesor is back online.%ROBOT: Roger that, we copy. How does it look down there?%YOU: Like I've arrived to hell itself.

ROBOT: Before you continue with your primary mission, you need to find the first inspector.  We can't take the chance that these humans, dumb as they are, discover our secrets.  You must destroy the data in his memory banks, after uploading a copy for us.%YOU: I knew the man personally, I will do my best. Out.
ROBOT: Wow, theres over 30 gigaquads of data here. Get back to the ship and upload it.%YOU: He died horribly and painfully.%ROBOT: This is no time for mourning, he knew the risks.
YOU: Data uplink succesful sir.%ROBOT: Yes I can see it, It will take years to study all of it.%ROBOT: Listen very carefully Inspector. You are to continue with your primary mission, but very carefully. We can't afford any screw ups this time. Study and observe these humans, gather as much data as possible.%ROBOT: DO NOT directly engage in conversation with anyone!

YOU: (Thinking to yourself) Wow, my superiors will love this. I could make a career out..of...studying....her....(Images of you and Jane in your house suddenly flood your thoughts, memories you didn't think were yours fly by your mind at the speed of light)%YOU: (Thinking to yourself) I need to find out what just happened to me. Were those memories real? It...can't be. I can't go to my superiors about this....maybe, maybe Joe will help me. He did before.
YOU: Hi there Joe, there's a problem...you see, I feel kind of human.%JOE: Well you look human to me. I feel the same way sometimes.%YOU: No, you don't understand. There's something wrong. Like I'm wearing a blindfold and its slipping off, but I can't quite see yet.%JOE: Have you been having hallucinations, drugs aren't the answer.%YOU: No, I'm not taking drugs, I just need your help to clear my head.%JOE: Well, I have here somewhere special medicen I saved for a rainy day, and it doesn't look like it's gonna come down any harder, so here take it.
JOE: Well, did that do the trick?%YOU: Joe, look I'm...I'm...human.%JOE: So I've noticed.%YOU: My skin, look...it's pinkish and hairy. And my clothes, they look horrible.%JOE: You're a pretty sharp dresser actually, you just need some rest, go home.%YOU: Thank you Joe, you have no idea how relieved I am. But the realization of what must be done now weighs heavily on my mind.

ATTENTION HUMAN: We know that you have begun to understand what is really happening, or at least as much as your limited intelligence allows. We have no need of you, except for the information you carry in your head.%If you follow my instructions, you will get your life back. Bring your carcass along with Jane to the ship, and I will contact you again.
YOU: I've got to go get Jane first.
ALIEN: Human, come closer. We need the information you carry.%YOU: Wait, first tell me why. Why do all of this?%ALIEN: Since your memory will be wiped, I might as well tell you. It's simple. After the first ugly incident, we would neve send another inspector to your world. So we needed some other way.%ALIEN: That's were you come in. We sent an unmaned ship to Earth. Curious as you humans are, you stumbled onto it. The equipment onboard implanted you with false memories while blocking your old ones.%ALIEN: Thinking you are an Inspector, you set out to complete our missions. The blurred vision and "short-term memory loss", hahahahahh, were probably a result of the procedure.%YOU: Fine whatever, just get these things out of my head and leave us alone. But I swear, If we ever meet again...I will kill you.
ALIEN: Don't make threats your not prepared to execute. In a year or so we will arrive again, and it will be either with a diplomatic party or an army. Judging by the likes of you, It will probably be the latter.%ALIEN: Enough of this. Step closer so we can begin. It will be...unpleasant.%(A few agonizing minutes later the ship starts to fly off, leaving you and Jane in a dazed and barely living state.)
JANE: How did we get here?% YOU: I dont know, lets get out of here.
